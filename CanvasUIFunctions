Geometry is a spatial and logical intensive course that students are not well equipped or prepared for due to learning Algebra in the previous grade. Textbooks are difficult to understand when it comes to 3D shapes. These lessons can be better taught in a AR/VR environment with real life examples that are augmented in AR or generated examples in VR. With the help of AR/VR, students will learn geometry in a much friendlier environment and have a greater understanding of what they are learning using real-life objects. Lessons taught in geometry will be reinforced throughout the project and students will be able to refer back for basic fundamentals of geometry for their high school course. This software is focused solely on providing information needed to understand Geometry and reinforce ideas taught in geometry when the student needs help. Teachers can use it as a way to help students refer back to fundamentals that are critical in understanding geometry such as coordinate grids, basic shapes, angles and degrees, etc. This software is NOT meant to teach geometry but to aid in the learning and understanding of geometry. While AR/VR would be ideal for this software, for the purposes of this course it will be demonstrated in WebGL Build.";
